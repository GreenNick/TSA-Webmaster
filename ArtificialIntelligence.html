        <h2>What Is It?</h2>
        <p>By definition, artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Error Reduction: Artificial intelligence helps us in reducing the error and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility. Intelligent robots are fed with information and are sent to explore space.They are created and in such a way that they cannot be modified or get disfigured or breakdown in the hostile environment.</li>
          <li>Difficult Exploration: Artificial intelligence and the science of robotics can be put to use in mining and other fuel exploration processes. Not only that, these complex machines can be used for exploring the ocean floor and hence overcoming the human limitations.</li>
          <li>Daily Application: Computed methods for automated reasoning, learning and perception have become a common phenomenon in our everyday lives. We have our lady Siri or Cortana to help us out. We are also hitting the road for long drives and trips with the help of GPS. Smartphone in an apt and every day is an example of the how we use artificial intelligence. In utilities, we find that they can predict what we are going to type and correct the human errors in spelling. When we take a picture, the artificial intelligence algorithm identifies and detects the person’s face and tags the individuals when we are posting our photographs on the social media sites. Artificial Intelligence is widely employed by financial institutions and banking institutions to organize and manage data.</li>
          <li>Digital Assistants: Highly advanced organizations use ‘avatars’ which are replicas or digital assistants who can actually interact with the users, thus saving the need of human resources. For artificial thinkers, emotions come in the way of rational thinking and are not a distraction at all. The complete absence of the emotional side, makes the robots think logically and take the right program decisions.</li>
          <li>Medical Applications: In the medical field also, we will find the wide application of AI. Doctors assess the patients and their health risks with the help of artificial machine intelligence. It educates them about the side effects of various medicines. Medical professionals are often trained with the artificial surgery simulators. It finds a huge application in detecting and monitoring neurological disorders as it can simulate the brain functions. Robotics is used often in helping mental health patients to come out of depression and remain active. A popular application of artificial intelligence is radiosurgery. Radiosurgery is used in operating tumors and this can actually help in the operation without damaging the surrounding tissues.</li>
          <li>No Breaks: Machines, unlike humans, do not require frequent breaks and refreshments. They are programmed for long hours and can continuously perform without getting bored or distracted or even tired.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reduces Mortality Rate</h3>
        <p>In the medical field, AI is being designed to assist doctors (not replace them) in the effort to reduce the mortality rate among patients awaiting care from specialists.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ai-floating-box">
        <h3>Fast and Accurate Diagnostics</h3>
        <p>They are able to accurately diagnose some diseases including malignant melanoma, eye problems, and many forms of cancer by analyzing spectral information and diagnostic criteria.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ai-floating-box">
        <h3>Reduces Errors Related to Human Distress</h3>
        <p>Doctors see a plethora of patients per week, which can be very exhausting considering the individual amount of attention and knowledge each person requires. Unlike a human doctor, AI is not worn down nearly as fast by numbers of patients, long work hours, and task completing.</p>
