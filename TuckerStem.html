      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Throughout DeKalb County, Tucker High School is predominantly known for its aptitude in sports such as football and basketball. Despite the large emphasis placed on competitive sports, Tucker also has a solid academic foundation, through its S.T.E.M. Two prime examples of this being the school’s VEX robotics and TSA programs, which both help cultivate future engineers by allowing students to utilize their problem solving skills to overcome problems presented to them.</p>

      <h2>How We Do It</h2>
      <p>The STEM Program at Tucker High School is a cohort-style, problem-based learning model. Students are selected to join a one-class cohort in 9th grade where the students travel to their core STEM classes together, including Science, Math, Engineering, and Literature. This is carried out over all 4 years of the high school program and the curriculum include accelerated, honors, gifted, or Advanced Placement courses. Every teacher involved with our program works together to institute a collaborative and engaged environment where the students learn in a connected way.</p>

      <h2>Our Projects</h2>
      <p>At Tucker, we integrate many projects and Project Based Learnings (PBLs) for the students to join together and come up with solutions using the subjects covered in STEM. The school’s own greenhouse, algae/sediment accumulation at Kelly Cofer Lake, and the carbon footprint are some of many challenges assigned here. Usually, a solution is chosen, and then we branch off into subcategories for the said solution. This process is ongoing from PBL to PBL and can be modified at any time.</p>
